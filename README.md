Description: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This Python script implements a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that allows a user to play against the computer. The game proceeds as follows:

The user is prompted to input their choice among 'rock', 'scissors', or 'paper'.
The input is validated to ensure it is one of the allowed choices, and any leading or trailing spaces are removed.
The computer randomly selects one of the three options ('rock', 'scissors', or 'paper').
The user's choice and the computer's choice are compared to determine the outcome of the game:
If both choices are the same, the game is a tie.
If the user's choice beats the computer's choice, the user wins.
If the computer's choice beats the user's choice, the user loses.
The result of the game (tie, win, or loss) is then displayed to the user.
This script includes error handling to ensure that the user's input is valid and provides debugging statements to show the user's input and the computer's choice during gamepla
